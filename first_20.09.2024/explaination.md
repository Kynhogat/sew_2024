This application is great in managing **weekly meal plans** in the campus dining hall.

Console App for Meal Plan Management
------------------------------------

So, your task is to implement the meal plan management for the campus dining hall.

The application shall provide following user storie(s).

_As a manager of the dining hall I need to handle meal plans for a whole year so that I have at each time a weekly overview of the provided meals._

* * *

Consider the following facts.

*   Each week is defined by its week number (cw1, cw2, ..., cw52)
*   For each week there exists a meal plan that hosts menus for Monday to Friday
*   For each day (Monday-Friday) there are two, one or zero menus available (zero in case of holidays)
*   A menu consists of a soup and a main dish (which are represented as simple text)
*   At the beginning the yearly meal plans shall be empty

* * *

Some hints.

*   Define which classes shall be public and which data they provide
*   Think about the requested structures for implementing the meal plan management
*   Keep these structures private and not accessible for other classes
*   As menus and meal plans are requested for the whole year you could use arrays

* * *

### Deliver the following

1.  A UML class diagram for your meal plan management in form of a PDF.
2.  Test your classes by implementing a method for displaying the meal plan for particular weeks. Deliver representative test cases in form of a PDF.
